  aboutLong: `Hello! I'm John, a software engineer based in San Francisco with a passion for creating
              elegant solutions to complex problems. My journey in web development started in 2017,
              and since then, I've had the privilege of working with startups, agencies, and tech companies.

              I love working at the intersection of design and engineering, creating applications that are
              not only functional but also beautiful and user-friendly. When I'm not coding, you can find
              me exploring new technologies, contributing to open source, or sharing my knowledge through
              blog posts and mentoring.

              My focus these days is on building accessible, performant web applications using modern
              technologies and best practices. I'm always excited to work on projects that have a positive
              impact on people's lives.`,
